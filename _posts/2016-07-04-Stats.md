CPhyGS and CELL program have engaged Rick White from SCARL to host two workshops on:

T-tests and ANOVAs (Oct.12 2-4pm LSI): For when you comparing multiple groups with quantitative measurements.
Repeated Measures ANOVAs (Mixed Models)(Oct.19 2-4pm LSI): For when you are taking multiple measurements from the same animal (e.g. mouse blood glucose over timepoints).

These workshops will use real example data from biologists! Come join your fellow biologists and learn about the theory and application of these tests, as well as ask questions together about common issues.
