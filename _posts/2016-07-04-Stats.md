CPhyGS and the CELL program have engaged Rick White from SCARL to host two Statistics for Biologists workshops on:

T-tests and ANOVAs (Oct.12 2-4pm LSI): For when you comparing multiple groups with quantitative measurements.

Repeated Measures ANOVAs (Mixed Models)(Oct.19 2-4pm LSI): For when you are taking multiple measurements from the same animal (e.g. mouse blood glucose over timepoints).

These workshops will use real example data from biologists! Come learn and ask your pressing questions in a room full of biologists!
