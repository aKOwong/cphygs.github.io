Hey CELL program and CPS department, 
We are planning a Trivia Night for you guys to test your knowledge and have some well deserved fun. This event is scheduled for 7pm April 6th @ Displace Hashery! Early bird tickets will be sold for $15 each, and this will get you a craft beer, and lots of appies! We are working tirelessly on trivia questions, and anticipate giving away MANY prizes so we hope to see you there. Only 40 tickets are available, so get them while they last. Tickets sold the same day as the event will be $20 each. If you have concerns, comments, or suggestions on how you would like the Trivia Night event to go down, email us at cphygs@gmail.com.

Stay tuned for where/when to buy tickets!

Best,

Your CPhyGS
