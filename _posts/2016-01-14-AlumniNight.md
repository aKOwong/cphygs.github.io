As an undergraduate, he was the recipient of several student research awards and worked in the laboratory of Dr. Christopher Overall learning about musculoskeletal research. He briefly worked as a lab technician in the UBC Department of Microbiology before studying the role of cilia in the onset and progression of polycystic kidney disease for his Masterâ€™s degree at SFU with Dr. Lynne Quarmby. Bryan began another graduate degree at UBC at the Child and Family Research Institute with Dr. Brad Hoffman where he studied transcriptional regulation of islet function and survival in the context of diabetes. He recently graduated with his PhD in Cell and Developmental Biology and is now a Medical Science Liaison for GlaxoSmithKline in Vancouver where he educates medical professionals on vaccine research and development.


**Charis Segeritz-Walko, PhD**  
*R&D Scientist, STEMCELL Technologies*  
Charis grew up in Germany and moved to Vancouver in 2005. She completed her B.Sc. at UBC in Cell Biology and Genetics in 2009 and M.Sc. in Experimental Medicine in 2011. In order to further pursue her passion for scientific research, she relocated to England for her Ph.D. at the University of Cambridge. During that time, she studied the mechanisms of inherited liver diseases using human induced pluripotent stem cells differentiated towards liver cells. After completion of her Ph.D. in 2015, Charis returned to Vancouver to join the biotechnology company STEMCELL Technologies as a Research and Development Scientist.

**Rhonda Wideman, PhD**

She works across the full spectrum of business development and alliance management activities, including identification and evaluation of strategic alliances and R&D relationships, negotiation of licensing and collaboration agreements, and managing ongoing alliances with strategic partners.  She previously worked as an independent consultant offering strategic planning and scientific and business analysis services to a range of life sciences clients, and at the PROOF Centre of Excellence, where she was responsible for biomarker discovery and development activities, including technical assessment, business development, and intellectual property management. 

Dr. Wideman holds a PhD from the University of British Columbia, where her research focused on novel approaches for treating diabetes using cellular and gene therapy. She  completed a MBA in Management of Biotechnology at Simon Fraser University in 2010. Dr. Wideman is a past recipient of NSERC's Canada Graduate Scholarship, CIHR's Science to Business Scholarship, and BC Innovation Council's Ripples of Hope Award in Biotechnology and Entrepreneurship, and was an invited participant at Novartis' International Biotechnology Leadership Camp in 2009.

Leon currently works as a Senior Research Associate at STEMCELL Technologies where he develops products for human pluripotent stem cell differentiation. A graduate of the UBC Biochemistry Co-op Program, Leon completed a MSc. (2013) in Calvin Yip's lab where he characterized the first electron microscopy structure of an Autophagy protein complex.

**Annie Aftab, PhD**  
*Industrial Post-Doctoral Fellow, Centre for Drug Research and Development*  
Annie is a recent PhD graduate from the Cell and Developmental Biology program. She did her PhD in the Naus laboratory where she discovered that gap junction mediated intercellular communication influences glioma cell migration by affecting their migration pattern. She then worked in the Loewen laboratory where she optimized an assay to look at the affect of acid stress on cancer cells. Annie has recently started as an industrial post-doctoral fellow at the Center for Drug Research and Development in the screening division. Her job at the CDRD is to design and optimize assays to identify novel therapeutic compounds.
