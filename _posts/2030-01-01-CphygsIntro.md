Greetings everyone, we're your new graduate student society representing
the CELL grad program and CPS department grad students!

Our aim is to:  
1. Provide professional development opportunities.  
2. Create a strong sense of community.  
3. Advocate on behalf of grad students.  

We have a lot of events in the works, and we'll keep you updated as they develop.
But we'd love for you to help us! Send as an email at cphygs@gmail.com if you'd
like to join the planning committee (we're real friendly!), or if you have any
suggestions or anything you'd like to discuss!

Happy Sciencing!
- Your CPhyGS Planning Committee
