CPhyGS is a graduate student society representing over 80 graduate students in
the Cellular and Physiological Sciences Department and the
Cell and Developmental Graduate Program at the University of British Columbia. 
We aim to provide ample professional developmental opportunities and 
build a strong community for graduate students cell biology, physiology, and allied
fields. We also serve as a central hub for advocacy of graduate student issues and concerns.
Our events are open to all, including postdocs, PIs, and research staff, as well
people from outside of CPS and CELL.
