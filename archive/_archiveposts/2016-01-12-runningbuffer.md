Love to run? Want to love to run? Want to pretend to love to run? 
Come on out and join the CPhyGS Running Buffers Sun Run team as we train for the iconic 32nd annual Vancouver Sun Run! Featuring a 10k course
along the beautiful Vancouver seawall, the Sun Run is a perfect opportunity
to sweat and exercise your body after many long hours of hunchbacked pipetting.
And we can get brunch afterwards! **March 17** is the team signup deadline!

For the extra ambitious, training runs are ongoing on Tuesday and Thursday mornings.
Contact Leslie Chan for details.
